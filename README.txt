Researcher:

James is a software engineer trying to use machine learning to recognize numbers in image files, but needs a significantly large, categorized data set to train his neural network. He collects together tons of images containing numbers and uploads those files to our platform for labeling, allowing everyone to view and edit the set. Some time later, he gets a notification that other users (editors) have updated the set, associating number labels with the different images. Now that the labeling was complete, James is able to take his data set and the associations to train his neural network. He takes away the edit permissions on the platform so no more changes can be made, but still leaves viewing permissions for everyone so other users (students) can use this completely labeled data set for their own personal projects.



Editor:

Frank is an audio editor and music producer. He collaborates with a chosen few, who all contribute to their collection of raw sounds clips that any of them can use in their music. They have been working together for a few years now and the amount of audio clips has grown. Frank and his team upload their dataset to our platform and Frank gets to work assigning various text labels to the clips. By narrowing down their searches using Frankâ€™s labels, they can access exactly what they are looking for more efficiently. Frank can change the privacy settings so only their group can access the audio clips and they can individually download whatever clips they need.

Student:

Tom is a junior in college working towards his Political Science degree. Tom is now midway through the year and he has tons of papers to write and they are about broad topics. He would love a platform where everyday people can be the ones to tag and label articles and sources so it's easier for him to come by relevant information. He uses our platform to search for data sets that fit his needs. Using the various tools to narrow his search criteria, he is able to examine specifically data sets that are already completely labeled, containing links to articles and labeled to indicate their subject matters for easier categorization and searching . He finds a set pertaining to his studies and is able to download the data and its associations for use in his school work.
